    "\n",
    "We have covered in detail much of the basics of python's primitive data types. Its now useful to consider how these basic types can be collected in ways that are meaningful and useful for a variety of tasks. Data structures are a fundamental component of programming, a collection of elements of data that adhere to certain properties, depending on the type. In these notes, we'll present three basic data structures, the list, the set, and the dictionary. Python data structures are very rich, and beyond the scope of this simple primer. Please see [the documentation](http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html) for a more complete view.\n"

    "\n",
    "A list, sometimes called and array or a vector is an ordered collection of values. The value of a particular element in a list is retrieved by querying for a specific index into an array. Lists allow duplicate values, but but indicies are unique. In python, like most programming languages, list indices start at 0, that is, to get the first element in a list, request the element at index 0. Lists provide very fast access to elements at specific positions, but are inefficient at \"membership queries,\" determining if an element is in the array. \n",
    "\n",
    "In python, lists are specified by square brackets, `[ ]`, containing zero or more values, separated by commas. Lists are the most common data structure, and are often generated as a result of other functions, for instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "`a_string.split(\" \")`\n",
    "\n",
    "will take a string, split it on space, and then return a list of the smaller substrings.\n",
    "\n",
    "To query a specific value from a list, pass in the requested index into square brackets following the name of the list. Negative indices can be used to traverse the list from the right. (Remember the case with strings and accessing the individual characters? It is exactly the same. In fact, strings are treated in Python as lists of characters.)"

    "\n",
    "And while Russian officials and diplomats rallied behind President Vladi­mir Putin, the Kremlin’s stance appeared further clouded by acknowledgments that the missions have already extended beyond solely the Islamic State.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Paris, the Russian ambassador to France, Alexander Orlov, said the Russian attacks also targeted an al-Qaeda-linked group, Jabhat al-Nusra, or al-Nusra Front.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syria’s ambassador to Russia, Riad Haddad, echoed that the joint hit list for Russia and the Syrian government included Jabhat al-Nusra, which is believed to have some coordination with the Islamic State but is still seen mostly as a rival.\n",
    "\n",
    "“We are confronting armed terrorist groups in Syria, regardless of how they identify themselves, whether it is Jabhat al-Nusra, the ISIL or others,” he said, using one of the acronyms for the Islamic State.\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphic Did the Russians really strike the Islamic State? VIEW GRAPHIC \n",
    "“They all are pursuing ISIL ends,” he added, according to the Interfax news agency.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ambassadors did not specifically mention any U.S.- and Western-backed rebel groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the comment was certain to deepen suspicions by Washington and allies that Putin’s short-term aim is to give more breathing space to Syria’s embattled President Bashar al-Assad, whose government is strongly supported by Moscow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syrian activists, meanwhile, ramped up their own claims that Moscow was hitting groups seeking to bring down Assad, who has managed to hang on during more than four years of civil war.\n",
    "\n",
    "Russia’s expanding military intervention in Syria added urgency to separate efforts by Russia and U.S. officials to coordinate strategies against the Islamic State and avoid potential airspace missteps between the two powers — so-called “deconfliction” talks. The Pentagon said the discussions will begin Thursday.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Washington weighs next move]\n",
    "\n",
    "One monitoring group, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said Russian airstrikes again struck strongholds of an American-backed rebel group, Tajamu Alezzah, in central Hama province.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ground level: On the scene of controversial Russian airstrikes in Syria\t\n",
    "View Photos\tThe actions, quickly criticized by Washington, add an unpredictable element to a multilayered war.\n",
    "The observatory also reported that airstrikes hit the northwestern city Jisr al-Shughour, which is in the hands of rebel groups including al-Nusra, after battles last month to drive back Assad’s forces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among the locations hit was a site near Kafr Nabl, the northern Syrian town whose weekly protests against the government, often featuring pithy slogans in English, won it renown as a symbol of what began as a peaceful protest movement against the Assad regime. The local council receives U.S. assistance, and the rebel unit there has received support under a covert CIA program aimed at bolstering moderate rebels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Raed Fares, one of the leaders of the protest movement in Kafr Nabl, said warplanes struck a Free Syrian Army checkpoint guarding Roman ruins on the outskirts of the town. He said the explosion was bigger than anything local residents had seen in three years of airstrikes conducted by Syrian warplanes.\n",
    "\n",
    "“It made a fire six kilometers wide,” he told The Washington Post.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other sites hit on the second day of Russian bombing included locations in the province of Hama. The targets suggested the main intention of the strikes was to shore up government control over a corridor of territory linking the capital, Damascus, to the Assad family’s coastal heartland, where the Russians are operating out of an expanded air base.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syrian rebels, some of them U.S.-backed, had been making slow but steady gains in the area, considered one of the government’s biggest vulnerabilities. There has been no Islamic State presence there since January 2014, when moderate rebels rose up against the extremists and forced them to retreat to eastern Syria.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Kerry warns of ‘grave concerns’ about Russia’s intent]\n",

    "In Washington, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) told CNN he could “absolutely confirm” that airstrikes hit Western-backed groups such as the Free Syrian Army and other factions “armed and trained by the CIA.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“We have communications with people there,” said McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n",
    "\n",
    "The accounts could not be independently assessed, but the main focus of the Russian attacks appeared to be in areas not known to have strong Islamic State footholds.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Moscow, the reply was blunt.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Total rubbish,” Gennady Zyuganov, a member of parliament and leader of Russia’s Communist Party, said of the U.S. accusations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In televised remarks Thursday, Putin called accusations that Russian airstrikes had killed civilians in Syria “information attacks.”\n",
    "\n",
    "He also addressed concerns about an accidental military clash between Russian and U.S.-led coalition forces, saying that his intelligence and military agencies were “establishing contacts” with counterparts in the United States.\n",
    "\n",
    "“This work is ongoing, and I hope that it will conclude with the creation of a regularly acting mechanism,” he said.\n",
    "\n",
    "A spokesman for Russia’s Defense Ministry, Igor Konashenkov, said Thursday that warplanes hit a dozen Islamic State sites in the past 24 hours, destroying targets including a command center and two arms depots.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Russia’s strategy in Syria could be a work in progress]\n",
    "\n",
    "The United States and Russia agree on the need to fight the Islamic State but not about what to do with the Syrian president. The Syrian civil war, which grew out of an uprising against Assad, has killed more than 250,000 people since March 2011 and sent millions of refugees fleeing to countries in the Middle East and Europe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accusing Russia of “pouring gasoline on the fire,” Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter vowed that U.S. pilots would continue their year-long bombing campaign against the Islamic State in Syria, despite Moscow’s warning that American planes should stay away from its operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I think what they’re doing is going to backfire and is counterproductive,” Carter said on Wednesday.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet Russia’s military flexing in Syria brought quick overtures from neighboring Iraq, where the Islamic State also holds significant territory but the government is within Washington’s fold.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iraq’s prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, told France 24 that he “would welcome” Russia joining the U.S.-led airstrikes against Islamic State targets, but there have been no specific discussions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Joining the protests against the Russian airstrikes was Saudi Arabia, a leading foe of Assad and one of Washington’s top Middle East allies.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the United Nations late Wednesday, the Saudi ambassador, Abdallah al-Mouallimi, demanded that the Russian air campaign “stop immediately” and accused Moscow of carrying out attacks in areas outside the control of the Islamic State.\n",

    "\n",
    "ENLARGE\n",
    "Yet it also shows how few policy options the BOJ has left. The central bank is already buying ¥80 trillion ($674 billion) in assets a year, putting nearly a third of Japan’s massive bond market in its hands. It left the size of that asset-buying program unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "After three years of BOJ asset purchases, inflation expectations in Japan are sagging, and recent volatility in global markets has threatened to undo some of what the BOJ had achieved with its extraordinary easing: a weaker yen and higher stock prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "BOJ Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda said the decision to introduce negative rates was meant to limit the risk that global conditions would derail the central bank’s efforts to change Japan’s “deflationary mindset.”\n",

    "The Bank of Japan is now the second major central bank to set negative interest rates, joining the European Central Bank, which first did so in 2014. The central banks of Sweden, Denmark and Switzerland also have negative interest-rate policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The introduction of negative rates once again signaled Mr. Kuroda’s willingness to shock markets. He denied in recent days that the bank was considering negative rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Kuroda has maintained that three years of aggressive quantitative easing have had “intended effects.” He has blamed falling oil prices for the low inflation and pointed to a price index that excludes energy prices as evidence that underlying inflation is strong.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet those policies have failed to produce the targeted 2% inflation, and the BOJ on Friday again pushed back the expected time frame for reaching that goal, while again lowering its inflation forecast for the fiscal year beginning in April.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many economists had concluded that the asset-buying program was nearing the limits of its capacity and effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Takuji Okubo, chief economist at Japan Macro Advisors, said the BOJ made the right decision in introducing negative rates—given the limited options available to it. “I don’t think purchasing more JGBs [Japanese government bonds] would have done much,” he said.\n",
    "\n",
    "ENLARGE\n",
    "The BOJ said it would leave unchanged the 0.1% rate on most existing reserves held at the central bank, while cutting the rate on required reserves to zero and charging 0.1% on reserves in excess of those required.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a news conference later Friday, Mr. Kuroda reiterated his running pledge that the BOJ would take additional action if necessary. He didn’t rule out the possibility of increasing the BOJ’s asset-buying.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the rate regime was to push down borrowing costs to stimulate inflation, the bank said in a statement following its two-day policy meeting. It also said it would cut the interest rate further into negative territory if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below-zero rates are used to encourage lending and spur credit growth. When imposed on banks’ reserves with a central bank, financial institutions typically look to lend more or invest elsewhere, in turn boosting asset prices, according to Oxford Economics economists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just how effective the BOJ’s move might be is unclear. European central banks that have adopted negative interest-rate policies were aiming to reduce short-term market rates and weaken the exchange rate, economists from London-based think tank Oxford Economics said in a January research note.\n",
    "\n",
    "Denmark and Sweden struggled to weaken their respective currencies, though, because their biggest trading partner, the eurozone, followed suit to push rates into negative territory, they said.\n",
    "\n",
    "While economists are still assessing the full impact of negative interest rates on inflation and economic activity in Europe, many say the policy has pushed down banks’ borrowing rates and longer-term bond yields.\n",
    "\n",
    "Japanese banks will face a more challenging environment as a result of negative rates, but won’t be badly hurt, analysts said. Most of the extra cash they have raised selling government bonds is now parked at the BOJ because domestic lending is sluggish and banks have a hard time finding attractive investments.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I don’t think there will be a big immediate impact on banks’ profitability,” S&P analyst Kiyoko Ohora said, noting the BOJ’s decision to leave the rate on existing reserves unchanged.\n",

    "\n",
    "There are many opportunities to combine data types in python. Lists can be populated by arbitrary data structures. Similarly, you can use any type as the value in a dictionary. However, the elements of sets, and the keys of dictionaries need to have some special properties that allow the mechanics of the data structure to determine how to store the element.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aside: to use a particular element in a set or as a key in a dictionary, it must define a [hash function](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function), `__hash__`. In a nutshell, a hash function maps a data element to a number in a predefined range, based on the characteristics of that element. Because the contents of a data structure might change, so too would the value of their associated `__hash__` function, causing problems for the algorithms powering sets and dictionaries."
